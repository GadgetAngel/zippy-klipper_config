# Rootiest Zippy Klipper

This is my klipper_config that uses custom gcode macros extensively to enhance the 3d printing experience.

It was originally envisioned to allow data to be communicated from the Slicer to Klipper and then stored in variables for use by other macros during/before/after the print but I would like eventually for it to be a much more extensive project that truly takes advantage of what gcode macros can do!

## Notes

This is very, very much a work in progress! It's currently running in more or less this iteration on my Ender 3 v2, but it's constantly shifting and changing and at the moment is quite loosely thrown together. My suggestion is to look it over and borrow pieces you think you'd like to use. This project's main goal is to build a coherent collection of macros to dramatically improve the Klipper experience.

## Acknowledgments

Many parts of this project were borrowed quite heavily from other people's work. I am compiling a list of acknowledgements to include in this README before posting publicly.

For the moment, individual macro files should contain references to their original sources.
